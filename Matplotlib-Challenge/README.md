# Matplotlib-Challenge HW5


in this readME, you will find the pymaceuticals_starter data. 

	Combine the data into a single dataset
	Checking the number of mice.
	Getting the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint. 
	Get all the data for the duplicate mouse ID.
	Create a clean DataFrame by dropping the duplicate mouse by its ID.
	Checking the number of mice in the clean DataFrame.
	Generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen
	Generate a bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using Pandas
	Generate a bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using pyplot.
	Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas
	Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice 
	Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens:
	Merge this group df with the original dataframe to get the tumor volume at the last timepoint
	Put treatments into a list, for for loop (and later for plot labels)
	Locate the rows which contain mice on each drug and get the tumor volumes
